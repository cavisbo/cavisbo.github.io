            Egyptian civilization lasted for two thousand years. Besides well-known Pyramids, Egyptians also built Tombs, Temples and Palaces.
            The material that they used was sunbaked mudbrick and limestone. Egyptians also had a system of Mathematics and Astronomy,
            so many of their buildings where astronomically aligned.
            Ancient Egypt did not have only one style in architecture.
            It lasted from about 2,700 B.C.E. - 343 B.C.E.
            Egyptian architecture is divided in dynasties,
            which means it is also divided in certain periods:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Old Kingdom</li>
            <li>First Intermediate</li>
            <li>Middle Kingdom</li>
            <li>Second Intermediate</li>
            <li>New Kingdom</li>
            <li>Third Intermediate</li>
            <li>Late period</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Columns</h2>

        <img src="media/images/egypt/egypt2.jpg" alt="Egyptian Columns" height="300" width="auto">
       
        <p>
            Columns were carved from stone and Egyptians tried to carve organic forms, such as lotus and palm.
            They were also painted bright colors and filled with text and hieroglyphs and columns could be up to 24 metes high.
            As early as 2600 BC the architect Imhotep made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds,
            like papyrus, lotus and palm; in later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common. Their form is thought to derive from archaic reed-built shrines.

            Giza was a town in the Middle Egypt that belonged to the period of Old Kingdom and that town has pyramid complex with over 6 pyramids.

            Great Kings or Pharaohs were preparing to become Gods in the afterlife and they have built those pyramids for themselves.
